# cordova-help-bot
Help bot for Apache Cordova

This is currently running in the [Cordova Slack](http://slack.cordova.io).
Whenever a token in the form of CB-XXXX is mentioned, and the bot is present in the channel, it will grab the issue summary, resolution status, and issue status from JIRA and respond.
